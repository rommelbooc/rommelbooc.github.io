    "Queries": "How Does Fractional Ownership Differ From Time Shares?",
    "Answers": "Fractional owners are primarily driven by the economic benefits of the asset- as investors. Time Share owners are driven by the access to use of the property. Fractional ownership structures are designed to expand the base of investors with access to participate in the economic interests of the asset. Fractional ownership's business model is to effectively acquire and maximize value of the asset over the holding period through operating income and long term gain potential. Time share ownership is designed to maximize the initial purchase price value of the asset from the standpoint of the seller, typically create barriers to ownership transfer and limit cashflow and long term gains through management fees."

In the extremely unlikely event that a severe maintenance event strikes that exceeds this fund (and exceeds any available income for the property) we may arrange a short term loan to cover these costs, with principal & interest to be deducted from future income."

It is normal in the lower seasons of travel for occupancy to be lower and income levels to be reduced. Projected returns are based on an annual basis so you can expect some variation month to month\n- Unavailability or Collapse of Partbnb LLC platform makes it harder to re-sell your shares easily.

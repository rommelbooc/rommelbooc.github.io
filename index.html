          St. John Paul II College of Davao (SJPIICD) is a private,

          Evangelista family in 2000 as the Philippine College of Innovative
          Education (PHILCIE), which initially offered 12 undergraduate courses.
          As devout Catholics, the family was granted the permission by the Holy
          Father himself to rename the school with his name; thus, PHILCIE
          became John Paul II College of Davao in 2004.

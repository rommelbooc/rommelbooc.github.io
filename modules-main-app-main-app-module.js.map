With John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, he gained worldwide fame as a member of the Beatles, widely regarded as one of the most popular and influential acts in the history of rock music; his songwriting partnership with Lennon is one of the most celebrated of the 20th century. After the band's break-up, he pursued a solo career and later formed Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine.</p>\\r\\n                    <p>McCartney has been recognised as one of the most successful composers and performers of all time, with 60 gold discs and sales of over 100 million albums and 100 million singles of his work with the Beatles and as a solo artist.[2] More than 2,200 artists have covered his Beatles song \\\"Yesterday\\\", more than any other copyrighted song in history. Wings' 1977 release \\\"Mull of Kintyre\\\" is one of the all-time best-selling singles in the UK. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist in March 1999, McCartney has written, or co-written 32 songs that have reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and as of 2014 he has sold more than 15.5 million RIAA-certified units in the United States. McCartney, Lennon, Harrison and Starr received MBEs in 1965, and in 1997, McCartney was knighted for his services to music.</p>\\r\\n                    <p>McCartney has released an extensive catalogue of songs as a solo artist and has composed classical and electronic music. He has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as animal rights, seal hunting, land mines, vegetarianism, poverty, and music education. He has married three times and is the father of five children.</p>\\r\\n                  </article>\\r\\n                </section>\\r\\n              </div>\\r\\n          </div> -->\\r\\n          <!-- <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"col-md-4\\\">\\r\\n              <h5 class=\\\"content-header\\\">Regulation A Offerings</h5>\\r\\n              <hr />\\r\\n              <div class=\\\"sidelist\\\">\\r\\n                <ol class=\\\"list-padding\\\">\\r\\n                  <li>\\r\\n                    <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n                      <div class=\\\"col-md-10\\\">\\r\\n                        <a\\r\\n                          routerLink=\\\"/offering-information/palmetto-place\\\"\\r\\n                          routerLinkActive=\\\"active\\\"\\r\\n                          class=\\\"link\\\"\\r\\n                        >\\r\\n                          Palmetto Place, Private Placement Memorandum</a\\r\\n                        >\\r\\n                      </div>\\r\\n                      <div class=\\\"col-md-2\\\"></div>\\r\\n                    </div>\\r\\n                  </li>\\r\\n                </ol>\\r\\n              </div>\\r\\n              <hr />\\r\\n              <div class=\\\"sidelist\\\">\\r\\n                <ol class=\\\"list-padding\\\">\\r\\n                  <li value=\\\"2\\\">\\r\\n                    <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n                      <div class=\\\"col-md-10\\\">\\r\\n                        <a href=\\\"#\\\" class=\\\"link\\\"\\r\\n                          >Sample to show what inactive list is memorandum</a\\r\\n                        >\\r\\n                      </div>\\r\\n                      <div class=\\\"col-md-2\\\"></div>\\r\\n                    </div>\\r\\n                  </li>\\r\\n                </ol>\\r\\n              </div>\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"col-md-8\\\"><router-outlet></router-outlet></div>\\r\\n          </div> -->\\r\\n        </pg-tab>\\r\\n        <pg-tab>\\r\\n          <ng-template #TabHeading> Regulatory Fillings </ng-template>\\r\\n          <h5 class=\\\"content-header\\\">Regulatory Fillings</h5>\\r\\n          <pg-tabset Type=\\\"simple\\\" TabPosition=\\\"left\\\" extraTabClass=\\\"offerings-tabs\\\">\\r\\n            <pg-tab>\\r\\n              <ng-template #TabHeading>\\r\\n                <ol class=\\\"list-padding\\\">\\r\\n                  <li>\\r\\n                    <p class=\\\"link\\\">\\r\\n                      Form D - Notice of Exempt Offering of Securities\\r\\n                    </p>\\r\\n                  </li>\\r\\n                  <!-- <hr style=\\\"margin-right: 10px;\\\" /> -->\\r\\n                </ol>\\r\\n              </ng-template>\\r\\n              <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n                <regulatory-fillings></regulatory-fillings>\\r\\n              </div>\\r\\n            </pg-tab>\\r\\n            <!-- <pg-tab>\\r\\n              <ng-template #TabHeading>\\r\\n                <ol class=\\\"list-padding\\\">\\r\\n                  <li value=\\\"2\\\">\\r\\n                    <p class=\\\"link\\\">\\r\\n                      Sample to show what inactive list is memorandum\\r\\n                    </p>\\r\\n                  </li>\\r\\n                </ol>\\r\\n              </ng-template>\\r\\n              <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n                <div class=\\\"col-lg-12\\\">\\r\\n                  <h3>\\r\\n                    “ Nothing is <span class=\\\"semi-bold\\\">impossible</span>, the\\r\\n                    word itself says 'I'm\\r\\n                    <span class=\\\"semi-bold\\\">possible</span>'!
